# Java-Projects-8Queen
The classic 8 queen challenge
This is an attempt of solving the 8 queen challenge without using any online libraries. All algorithm are written from scratch.
The program should be able to find number of possible solution based on the board size.
You can then extract and print inidividual solution by setting "solution = <solution no>"
  
Note: This solution is not ideal and is checking all possible combination and "clashes".
